# Note Taker Application


## Description

The purpose of this application is to implement the functionality of express routing to allow the user to create and save notes.  In this assignment we were given the starter code which provided the front end of the application.  I learned how to implement the express.js which provides routes in creating, saving, and deleting notes. GET, POST and DELETE routes were created to make the application functional.  

## Installation

In order to use the express application you need to install the express module.  In the integrated terminal you need to perform npm install and then node server.js which will give you a message "App listening on port 3001".  Since this application is deployed through render the user will be able to access this through the link provided.  However, while developing the application it can be accessed by going to the following site. http://localhost:3001  

## Usage

To use this application you need to first click on the get started button.  This will redirect to the the note taker application.  Create a new note by enter the title of the note and then fill in the desired note information.  Once these field are entered the user can then click on save and the note will be saved.  After the note has been saved the user will be given the option to delete the note.
